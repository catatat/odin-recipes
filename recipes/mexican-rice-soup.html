      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is from <a href="https://www.forksoverknives.com/recipes/vegan-soups-stews/mexican-rice-soup/">Forks Over Knives</a>. Original description: Since this is such a thick soup, I like to have this rolled up in a tortilla for leftovers the next day. This recipe also lends itself well to using different ingredients that you have on hand. Switch up the beans, use some roasted corn, or add some kale. If you don't want it to be so thick, add some additional stock or water. Enjoy with the topping of your choice. We like chopped tomatoes, sliced scallions, salsa, and baked tortilla chips.</p>
